# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
//deploy
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts

//test cases
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

//deploy addresses
npx hardhat node

//coverage
npx hardhat coverage

```
